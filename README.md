# About Me
I caught fire hacking. ðŸ”¥

Since childhood, I have dreamed of writing code for a major enterpriseâ€”sipping iced drinks while crafting elegant software, and perhaps launching my startup someday. I dove into data structures and algorithms, but everything changed when I discovered Linux. The command lineâ€™s raw power and the open-source ethos sparked a passion for exploring systems and unraveling digital puzzles.

That passion led me to Capture the Flag competitions, where every challenge sharpened my creativity and problem-solving skills. Today, Iâ€™m a cybersecurity engineer balancing a Masterâ€™s in the Erasmus Mundus CYBERUS program at UniversitÃ© Bretagne Sud and the University of Luxembourg with real-world testing and research. Iâ€™m Certified in Cybersecurity by (ISC)Â², hold CompTIA Security+, and have built deep expertise in Splunk, Nessus, Caldera BAS, Autopsy, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

For nearly two years, Iâ€™ve taught hands-on information security at Cyber Talent Forge, guiding dozens of students through labs and real-world attack simulations. Off the clock, Iâ€™m proud to rank in the Top 3% globally on TryHackMe and to blog my experiences on Medium. My recent Red vs. Blue Team projectâ€”simulating a real-world breach, defense, and investigation with Splunk and COMODO EDRâ€”exemplifies my drive to merge theory and practice. Next up: OSCP+ and CompTIA Pentest+ to keep leveling up and helping organizations stay secure.
